<h1>Where maps are missing</h1>
    <p></p>
<p>
Nowadays finding pockets of uncharted territory is quite unexpected, but this is still the case in South Sudan.<br>
We know where towns finish and where the next start, with often a sign on the road to let us know that. In South Sudan there are very few roads the majority of which are seasonal, disappearing with the rainy season and repairing during the dry one, maybe in the same place maybe not. <br>There are a handful of concrete buildings, with most of the population leaving in huts of mud and dry grass that can rise pretty quickly in fertile areas but also just as fast disappear under the sun and rain when abandoned.   
Through our smartphones, we are used to knowing in a few clicks where we are and how far our destination is, but what to do in a country where only a small fraction of territory is covered by phone network and electricity is the exception and not the norm?
<br>On top of this to blur even more the picture an ongoing civil war that makes travelling across land very dangerous and generates huge numbers of internally displaced persons moving across and outside the country.</p>
<p>
To support the work of the humanitarian organisations operating in the Country I published different reference maps, merging many different available datasets and checking them against local knowledge where possible.

<h2>States Atlas</h2>
<p>
Together with the <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.impact-repository.org/document/reach/94fd7237/reach_ssd_map_southsudan_15june2017_a3l_0.pdf">South Sudan reference map</a></b> I published also a <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.impact-repository.org/document/reach/f5e99332/reach_ssd_maps_stateatlas_7february2017.pdf">National Atlas </a></b>, which reporta the detailed location of several small villages, making use of the Humanitarian Data Exchange settlement dataset.

<h2>Capital Juba</h2>

<p> Juba, the capital of the Republic, has very few landmarks and tarmac roads but has a very intricate labyrinth of unpaved and unnamed roads that extend from the center to the outskirts of the city, making sometimes difficult to know in which neighborhood you are in. To support the NGOs during the yearly cholera response I created a city reference map, mapping all the neighborhoods, main roads and building footprints. This base map became crucial in the summer of 2016 when the city went through a sudden and unexpected outbreak of violence, that saw several citizens leaving their homes and seeking protection and humanitarian support in various sites.</p>
