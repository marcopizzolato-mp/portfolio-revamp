<p style="font-size: 23px;"><b>Welcome to my personal website!</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">In this space you will find a collection of my favourite projects and data adventures I have completed across my career. From when I was responding to the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan to earning my MSc in GIS at the University of Edinburgh and more recently pursuing my PG Degree in Data Engineering.<p>
</br>
<p style="font-size: 23px;"><b>A little about me...</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Dynamic and energetic, I am a driven individual who is passionate about the projects I take on. I am always looking for new challenges that will push my limits, bring out my creativity, and allow me to find innovative solutions. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and work closely with my team and peers to build lasting relationships and achieve common goals. </p> 
</br>
Take a look around my website to see some of my works, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to learn more about me!
